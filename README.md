# Astrothon

Taygete Astronomy based hackathon.

## Programming Language Used :- 
`Python`

## Dependencies

1. Python 3.10
2. Astropy library
3. pandas library
4. Matplotlib library
5. Numpy library
6. Math library
7. Cmath library

## Question 1 :- 

### Flux time graph for all star system are in same python files.

I drew the graph using `matplotlib` and accessed the `fits` file data using astropy.

* Star System 1 = Rishi_1
* Star System 2 = Rishi_2
* Star System 3 = Rachna
* Star System 4 = Ankur
* Star System 5 = Arush
* Star System 6 = Kushagra


## Question 3 :-

### All three parts are in same python file.

1. Age Calculation - Used Einstein's time dialatioon formula for calculating Chandra's age.

2. Time diagram demonstrating - Used `numppy` and `matplotlib` to draw the space time diagram and marked chandra's integer years with `.`.

3. Sending light signals - Used `numppy` and `matplotlib` to draw the space time diagram to show light signal communication.
